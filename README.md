# Learning-CSS

This is my first time learning and implementing CSS I'm starting from absolute basics and going my way through.
I have started to learn Full Stack Web Development so I can't spend to much time on the CSS but whatever I create in the next 3 4 days I'll post here
as my personal achivements.

Day 1 & 2:-
Creted the simple projects and a flag of Laos with the help of Internal CSS.
